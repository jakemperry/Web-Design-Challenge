# Web Design Challenge
This website presents the visualizations from the [Python API Challenge](https://github.com/jakemperry/python-api-challenge) project.  The site uses Bootstap version 5 to implement a nav bar and content columns that react to changes in screen size (i.e., this site will look different on a desktop browser compared to a phone browser, and will change dynamically if a desktop browser is resized to match the size of a phone browser)
